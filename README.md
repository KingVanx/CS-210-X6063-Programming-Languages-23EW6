CS-210-X6063 Programming Languages 23EW6
This project was built to allow users to see how their investments will grow over time. For the fictional company AIRGEAD BANKING, it allows the user to plan and strategize how much they should invest to reach their goals.

I personally do not believe I did anything particularly  well, as all I did was take what I had been learning and put it into practice; this code, though seemingly simple, took me quite a while I nail down, with about 3 days' worth of rework.

As I'm still new to coding in general, I can't say at this point where improvement could be made, I'm sure that as I learn more and especially as I enter the programming workforce, I will come back to these early assignments and projects, and see an area that could be much improved, and 
if I'm being honest i can't wait for those times of reflection, as in this project in particular i saw something i could use in my day to day budgeting (if i know how to code a bit better)
